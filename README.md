<!-- INTRODCUTION -->
## What is Go and SGX?

> Go is a programming language built to resemble a simplified version of the C programming language. It compiles at the machine level. Go was created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

[Overview of Go](https://go.dev/)

> Intel Security Guard Extension (SGX) delivers advanced hardware and RAM security encryption features, so called enclaves, in order to isolate code and data that are specific to each application. When data and application code run in an enclave additional security, privacy and trust guarantees are given, making the container an ideal choice for (untrusted) cloud environments.

[Overview of Intel SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/software-guard-extensions/overview.html)

Application code executing within an Intel SGX enclave:

- Remains protected even when the BIOS, VMM, OS, and drivers are compromised, implying that an attacker with full execution control over the platform can be kept at bay
- Benefits from memory protections that thwart memory bus snooping, memory tampering and “cold boot” attacks on images retained in RAM
- At no moment in time data, program code and protocol messages are leaked or de-anonymized
- Reduces the trusted computing base of its parent application to the smallest possible footprint

<!-- WHY -->
## Why use Go-SGX (instead of "vanilla" Golang Runtime) images?
Following benefits come for free with Go-SGX :

* Protect Golang code, files, applications, services, APIs, (AI) models against intelectual property theft/violation irrespectively where the application runs thanks to full fledge memory container encryption and integrity protection at runtime
* Shield container application against container escape attacks with hardware-graded security against kernel-space exploits, malicious and accidental privilege [insider](https://www.ibm.com/topics/insider-threats) attacks, [UEFI firmware](https://thehackernews.com/2022/02/dozens-of-security-flaws-discovered-in.html) exploits and other "root" attacks using the corruption of the application to infiltrate your network and system
* Build and deploy Golang application as usual while inheriting literally for free security and privacy through containerization including
    * strictly better TOMs (technical and organizatorial measures)
    * privacy export regulations compliant deployment anywhere, such as [Schrems-II](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf)
    * GDPR/CCPA compliant processing ("data in use") of user data (in the cloud) as data is relatively anonymized thanks to the enclave

<!-- DEPLOY IN THE CLOUD -->
## How to deploy Go-SGX in a zero-trust cloud?

The following cloud infrastractures are SGX-ready out of the box
* [Microsoft Azure Confidential Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/) 
* [OVH Cloud](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/dedicated/enable-and-use-intel-sgx/)
* [Alibaba Cloud](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-released-industrys-first-trusted-and-virtualized-instance-with-support-for-sgx-2-0-and-tpm_596821) 
* [Kraud Cloud](https://kraud.cloud/)

Confidential compute is a fast growing space. Cloud providers continiously add confidential compute capabilities to their portfolio. Please [contact](#contact) us if the infrastracture provider of your preferred choice is missing.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting started
### Platform requirements

Check for *Intel Security Guard Extension (SGX)* presence by running the following
```
grep sgx /proc/cpuinfo
```
Alternatively have a thorough look at Intel's [processor list](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000028173/processors.html). (We remark that macbooks with CPUs transitioned to Intel are unlikely supported. If you find a configuration, please [contact](#contact) us know.)

Note that in addition to SGX the hardware module must support FSGSBASE. FSGSBASE is an architecture extension that allows applications to directly write to the FS and GS segment registers. This allows fast switching to different threads in user applications, as well as providing an additional address register for application use. If your kernel version is 5.9 or higher, then the FSGSBASE feature is already supported and you can skip this step.

There are several options to proceed
* If: No SGX-ready hardware </br> 
[Azure Confidential Compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/") cloud offers VMs with SGX support. Prices are fair and have been recently reduced to support the [developer community](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/announcing-price-reductions-for-azure-confidential-computing/). First-time users get $200 USD [free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) credit. Other cloud provider like [OVH](https://docs.ovh.com/ie/en/dedicated/enable-and-use-intel-sgx/) or [Alibaba](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/alibaba-cloud-released-industrys-first-trusted-and-virtualized-instance-with-support-for-sgx-2-0-and-tpm_596821) cloud have similar offerings.
* Elif: Virtualization <br>
  Ubuntu 21.04 (Kernel 5.11) provides the driver off-the-shelf. Read the [release](https://ubuntu.com/blog/whats-new-in-security-for-ubuntu-21-04). Go to [download](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) page.
* Elif: Kernel 5.9 or higher <br>
Install the DCAP drivers from the Intel SGX [repo](https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx-driver)

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt -y install dkms
  wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.13.3/linux/distro/ubuntu20.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.41.bin -O sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
  chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin
  sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver.bin

  sudo apt -y install clang-10 libssl-dev gdb libsgx-enclave-common libsgx-quote-ex libprotobuf17 libsgx-dcap-ql libsgx-dcap-ql-dev az-dcap-client open-enclave
  ```

* Else: Kernel older than version 5.9 </br>
  Upgrade to Kernel 5.11 or higher. Follow the instructions [here](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2021/02/linux-kernel-5-11released-install-ubuntu-linux-mint/).   

### Software requirements
Install the docker engine
```sh
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER    # manage docker as non-root user (obsolete as of docker 19.3) 
```
Use `docker run hello-world` to check if you can run docker (without sudo).

<!-- GET THIS IMAGE -->
## Get this image

The recommended way to get the enclaive Go-SGX Open Source Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/enclaive/go-sgx).

```console
docker pull enclaive/go-sgx:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the
[list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/enclaive/go-sgx/tags/)
in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull enclaive/go-sgx:[TAG]
```

<!-- BUILD THE IMAGE -->
## Build the image
If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
docker build -t enclaive/go-sgx:latest 'https://github.com/enclaive/enclaive-docker-go-sgx.git#master'
```

## Test the image
The console outputs `Hello World`.

## Modify the image

Add the golang program to folder 
```/app``` 
and the program is run in a confidential compute environment.

<!-- RUN THE IMAGE -->
## Run the image
Run
``
docker compose up -d
``
to start the enclaved go application.
